Stock Notifier will provide real-time notification of tickers when it satisy your constraints on its price. You can choose multiple tickers at the same time. You can provide constraints/conditions for their price value and get notified when those constraints are satisfied. For example you can choose to get notification whenever the price for "SBIN" goes above 2000.<br>
You will get notification as soon as the constraint is satisfied.<br>
App also supports applying constraints on EMA of tickers and get notified when they are satisfied.<br>
App supports auto-completion of name of company, when you are adding tickers to your list.<br><br>
Note: You need to tick mark the checkbox given for each symbol to turn on its notification support.
